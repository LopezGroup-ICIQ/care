# FG-dataset

This directory contains the FG-dataset divided by chemical family. Some notes:

- For each functional group, all the corresponding molecules containing up to 4 carbon atoms have been included (except the aromatic rings).
- `group2` and `group2b` include the organic molecules containing 0/1 O atoms: alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and ethers.
- `group3S` contains molecules with one S atom: thiols, thials, thioketones and thioethers.
- `group3N` contains molecules with one N atom: amines and imines.
- `group4` contains molecules with 2/3 O atoms: carbonates, carboxylic acids and esters.
- `aromatics` and `aromatics2` include aromatic molecules with one and two rings respectively. These are the only two families that include molecules with more than 4 C atoms.
- `metal_surfaces` include the lowest-energy slabs used for adsorbing all the molecules of the FG-dataset. 8 fcc (111) slabs and 4 hcp (0001) metals.
