# Evaluators

This folder contains the available energy evaluators that can be used to evaluate the CRNs obtained with CARE. For the moment, GAME-Net-UQ is the only available evaluator.

We provide a [template](./template) folder where you can find the basic classes needed to implement your own evalautor, one interface for evaluating the species and one for the reaction properties.
