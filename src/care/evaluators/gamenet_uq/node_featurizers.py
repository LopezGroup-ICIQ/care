    """
    Return the (normalized) generalized coordination number (gcn) for each surface atom in the ASE Atoms object.
    gcn is defined as the sum of the coordination numbers (cn) of the neighbours divided by the maximum coordination number.
    gcn=0 atom alone; gcn=1 bulk atom; 0<gcn<1=surface atom.

    graph must have as attributes:
    - atoms (Atoms): ASE atoms object containing a slab with an adsorbate
    - node_feats (list[str]): list of node features to be used in the graph

    Args:
        atoms (Atoms): ASE atoms object containing a slab with an adsorbate
        adsorbate_elements (list[str]): list of symbols of the adsorbate elements

    Returns:
        Data: PyG Data object with the gcn as a node feature. Data.x.shape[1] increases by 1.
                Data.node_feats is also updated.
