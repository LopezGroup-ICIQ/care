# care-AI

This is the code repository of the Python software care-AI, for the automatic generation of reaction mechanisms for heterogeneous catalytic processes with uncertainty-based energy profiler.
It consists of 3 building blocks: 
 - R-Nets, for the automatic construction of reaction mechanisms for both thermal and electro heterogeneous catalytic processes
 - GAME-Net, a set of graph neural networks (GNNs) for the fast estimation of the adsorption energy of molecules (containing C, H, O, N, S) on 14 transition metal surfaces.
 - pyMKM, a microkinetic modeling tool for representing experimental reactors
