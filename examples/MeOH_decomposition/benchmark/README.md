# Information regarding the execution of the MeOH decomposition benchmark between ML models

This folder contains the necessary script and data to perform the benchmark between three state-of-the-art ML models presented in our work.

The csv file contains the experimental data obtained from CatTestHub (https://cpec.umn.edu/cattesthub)

The script has to be run in the benchmark directory (care/examples/MeOH_decomposition/benchmark) by running the following command:

```bash
python3 run_benchmark.py
```

To prevent RAM/CPU bottlenecks, the number of cores in the parallelization processes has been set to half of the available CPUs in your machine.

*NOTE: Evaluating all the CRNs and performing the microkinetic modeling can take quite some time.

Further details on this benchmark will be available once the paper has been published.
